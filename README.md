# A toy search frontend for YouTube

Made in order to test out AJAX with JSON.

Submits a query to YouTube's API and generates a[n incredibly unpolished] search-results page.

To-dos:
- Use your existing grid stylesheets to make the results look better.
- You could add < BACK and NEXT > buttons for add'l search results.
